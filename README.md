Open Source Audio Plugins
===================

A list of open source VST (and other format) plugin projects. The intention of this list is to catalog open source plugins which are fully featured and useful plugins which have non-trivial feature sets including advanced samples.

The main benefit of having Open Source plugins is that the code itself is preserved for the future, so when the author(s) stop updating it the community can continue using and developing the plugin. Open Source plugins are also a great way to learn how different audio FX/instruments are created.
